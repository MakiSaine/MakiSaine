# 🔐 Turning Curiosity into Secure Code  

Hi! I'm Maki 👋  
I love exploring how systems break and then figuring out how to make them stronger.  
From building small security tools to simulating DDoS attacks on my own lab servers,  
this is where I share my journey of learning breaking and building.
